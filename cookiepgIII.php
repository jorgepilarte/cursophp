Loans
A loan is a financial operation by which a person (lender) grants by means of a contract or agreement between the parties, an asset (usually an amount of money) to another person (borrower), in exchange for obtaining an interest (price of money).</h3>

<h4>The loans are considered a single benefit (principal) financial transaction and multiple consideration (payment of installments). The amortization, that is to say, the gradual return of the loan, will be made according to the duration, interest and agreements reached that allow to return the principal of the loan with the interest. Loans can be divided into several classes depending on their nature. So, we will say that it is a simple loan if interest is not paid regularly, or a loan with an American system if there is a periodic interest payment. There are several methods of financial amortization. In addition, sometimes the loans are of benefit and single consideration, since the total refund is agreed with an interest at the end of the duration of the same, that is, without the payment of installments.</h4>

<h2>Elements that make up a loan</h2>

<h3>These are the main concepts that we must know when receiving or working with loans:</h3>

<h4>• Principal capital: The amount of money that has been lent and on which an interest will be paid based on the duration of the loan and the risk of the borrower.
• Interest: It is the financial cost of the loan, that is, the price of money. It is the charge that is charged for the use of money or foreign capital for a time, and is represented as a percentage of the principal.
• Fee: Each of the return payments where the principal and interest are distributed.
• Term: It is the time during which the loan will be used. The term will run from the start of the contract until the last installment is paid, thus returning the entire principal and interest.
• Lender: It is the agent that lends the money, and to which it must be returned together with some interests.
• Borrower: Person who receives the capital and must return it according to the agreement, together with some interests.
Both the lender and the borrower can be natural persons or legal persons.

Main differences between a loan and a loan</h2>

<h4>
In terms of banking, a 'loan' and a loan, although they are similar, have differences. In the loan, the bank provides the client with an account, where the client will access the amount of money he needs and he usually pays the requested loan periodically, with the expenses and interest added by the entity.
On the other hand, in a 'loan', the bank makes available to the debtor a fixed amount of money, which must be returned, together with the interest, in a predetermined time. It is usually a medium or long term operation, which is amortized in regular installments, as the client pays it. However, in both cases, it is the banking institution that loans money so that in a certain term it is returned together with some interest (principal + interest).
